# letter-matrix-search
Search through a random matrix of letters in multiple directions

I created this project with my students @ Southern Careers Institute. 
http://www.scitexas.edu/programs/full-stack-javascript/

This code was created by my students in Cloud9, a collaborative code editor.

How this started:

- It started out as a basic example of how to store random numbers in an array. 
- Then we converted those numbers into letters. Then we arranged them on the screen with basic HTML. 
- Then we started to notice words in the letters and decided to try to search for names from left to right. 
- We needed a two dimensional array, which required refactoring the code.
- Then we wanted to search up, down, and left, as well as to the right.
- That's when I decided we should rotate the matrix of letters 90 degrees, instead of writing four search functions.  
- Learning to rotate the matrix was a fun, challenging project. We accomplished this with a large whiteboard.

Todo...

1. Make the matrix an object and then matrix.search(), matrix.rotate(), etc.
2. Search diagonally aka rotate matrix 45 degrees.
3. Highlight the found letters better.
